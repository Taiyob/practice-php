Welcome to the new home of Practical PHP Programming - 
Now updated for PHP 5.6 and renamed to Hacking with PHP. 
I've taken this opportunity to brighten up the design,
update the content, and make the site much more useful on mobile devices.

While updating the text, 
I have left chapters in place even
if I think they are no longer the smartest option - after all,
it's not for me to decide what you should use. 
In places where I recommend one solution over another, 
you'll find this clearly marked.
